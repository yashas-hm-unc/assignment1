## COMP 790 - Assignment 1

### Description
This is a simple starter game project in which the player is in a confined space with a target in front of them. The aim is to display darts at the target by tapping the screen of a phone fitted in Google Cardboard. <br>This is a game since it is constrained by an environment, has a challenge/objective (hitting the target), and has a reward (scoring for hitting the target).
